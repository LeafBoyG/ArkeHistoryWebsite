            <p class="lead-paragraph">When we talk about the Second World War, certain battles get all the limelight: Stalingrad, D-Day, the Battle of Britain. But right at the start, in the brutal, lightning-fast invasion of Poland in September 1939, a small, desperate fight took place that deserves to be legendary. This is the story of the Battle of Wizna, a clash so one-sided it has been called the "Polish Thermopylae".</p>
            
            <h2>The Cork in the Bottle</h2>
            <p>It was the first week of September 1939. The German war machine had smashed across the Polish border. The plan was <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A German term for 'lightning war,' a military tactic using mobile forces and concentrated firepower to cause disorganization among enemy forces.">Blitzkrieg</span>—"lightning war"—and a key part of it involved General Heinz Guderian's XIX Panzer Corps swinging down from East Prussia to encircircle Warsaw and cut off the Polish armies.</p>
            <p>But there was a problem, a natural bottleneck. To advance, Guderian's Panzers had to cross the Narew and Biebrza rivers through a small area near the village of Wizna. The Poles knew this was critical ground. Before the war, the area had been prepared as a fortified line of defence, designed to shield Polish positions further south. If they could hold the Germans here, even for a little while, they might buy precious time for their main forces to regroup.</p>

            <h2>David vs. Goliath: The Forces</h2>
            <p>The disparity in forces is, frankly, staggering. It’s what makes this battle so remarkable. The Polish defenders, commanded by Captain Władysław Raginis, consisted of somewhere between 350 and 720 men. They were equipped with a few anti-tank rifles, a couple of dozen machine guns, and their own rifles. That's it.</p>
            <p>In contrast, Guderian's XIX Panzer Corps dwarfed them with over 42,000 men, 350 tanks, nearly 200 artillery pieces, and overwhelming air support from the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II.">Luftwaffe</span>. Reportedly, Raginis knew the situation was hopeless and made his men swear an oath to hold their positions to the last man. He vowed he would not leave his post alive.</p>

            <h2>Three Days of Hell</h2>
            <p>The battle began on September 7th. The Luftwaffe softened up the Polish positions with bombing raids, followed by initial probes from German infantry and tanks. The Poles, dug in and determined, beat back these first attacks. By September 9th, the Germans realised this wasn't going to be a walkover. Becoming impatient with the delay, Guderian ordered a full-scale assault. The fighting was brutal, a grim battle of attrition. The Germans couldn't just bypass the bunkers; they had to be taken out one by one.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>By the morning of September 10th, the battle was all but over. Most of the bunkers had been destroyed, their crews killed or wounded. Captain Raginis, holding out in his own command bunker with the last handful of defenders, was completely surrounded. Guderian sent an envoy with an ultimatum: surrender, or every one of them would be killed.</p>
            <p>True to his oath to not leave his post alive, but wishing to save his men from the final slaughter, Raginis ordered the survivors to surrender. Then, after they had left the bunker, Captain Raginis pulled the pin on a grenade and ended his own life. He had held his post.</p>

            <h2>The Legacy of Wizna</h2>
            <p>Did the defence of Wizna change the course of the war? No. Guderian's corps was delayed for about two days, but the fall of Poland was inevitable. But that's missing the point. The stand at Wizna was a monumental act of defiance. A few hundred men, knowing they faced certain death, held up one of the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="The unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945.">Wehrmacht's</span> most powerful formations for three days. It became a powerful symbol of Polish courage and sacrifice, a story told to inspire resistance throughout the long, dark years of occupation that followed. Like the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, the defenders of Wizna lost the battle, but they won a place in history that will never be forgotten.</p>
